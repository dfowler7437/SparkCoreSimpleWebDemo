SparkCoreSimpleWebDemo
====================
This project demonstrates using HTML and JavaScript to access a Spark Core module. 
No server is required but you may need to edit and operate this file from a Web 
enabled development tool or Editor. I recommend Adobe Brackets.

This code is open I only ask that you let me know of any improvements 
and that you drop me an emial about your project. I may link back to it 
from my blog...

The project consist of two files.

html/index.html - The html file you want to load into your web IDE (ie.. Brackets)

firmware/SparkCoreSimpleWebDemo.cpp - The firmware file to cut and past into your Spark Web IDE. 

Note that the firmware file extension is .cpp here but will be .ino in the IDE.  I set it to .cpp
so that my text editor will do correct highlighting.
